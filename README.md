# Remotiscope
Remotiscope is a web app written in the Godot game engine, for remote-controlling Lixie Labs Emotiscope displays over WiFi!

This repository contains the Godot 3.5.3 project files and assets used to export Remotiscope. **NOTE:** *Godot 4.x is not yet used because 3.x still has better cross-compatibility between mobile browsers.*
